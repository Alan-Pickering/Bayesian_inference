# Bayesian_inference
A repository of some simple Matlab code which executes Bayesian inference <br>
The code here accompanies this blog post:-<br>
https://samplingdistribution.blogspot.com/2023/04/using-bayesian-inference-to-predict.html <br>
The Matlab version of the code is <b>numerical_bayes_fish.m</b> <br>
The version which runs under either Octave or Matlab is <b>numerical_bayes_fish_oct.m</b> <br>
This version calls the bespoke function <b>gfxn.m</b> <br>
However this model has a couple of features which are really naff and so an improved version <br>
will be posted here shortly. The revised version has this accompanying blog post:-<br>

The new code runs under either Octave or Matlab and is <b>Bayes_fish_oct_new.m</b><br>

# Bayesian_inference
A repository of some simple Matlab / Octave code which executes Bayesian inference <br>
The first code here (Matlab only) accompanies this blog post:-<br>
https://samplingdistribution.blogspot.com/2023/04/using-bayesian-inference-to-predict.html <br>
The name of the Matlab version only file is <b>numerical_bayes_fish.m</b> <br>
The version which runs under either Octave or Matlab is <b>numerical_bayes_fish_oct.m</b> <br>
The Octave compatible version calls the bespoke freestanding function <b>gfxn.m</b> <br>
The Octave compatible version has more detailed commenting than the Matlab only file.<br>
However this code implements a model which has a couple of features that are really naff, <br>
and so an improved version of the model has been created. <br>
The revised version of the model relates to this accompanying blog post:-<br>
{blog link here when published}<br>
The new code runs under either Octave or Matlab and is called <b>Bayes_fish_oct_new.m</b><br>
